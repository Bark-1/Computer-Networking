P6. Obtain the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616). Answer the following  questions:

a. Explain the mechanism used for signaling between the client and server to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed. Can the client, the  server, or both signal the close of a connection

> From section 8.1.2 in RFC 2616, we can know that: 
>
> Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes place using the Connection header field. And either the client or the server can indicate to the other that it is going to close the persistent connection.
>
> An HTTP/1.1 server MAY assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including  the connection-token "close" was sent in the request. If the server  chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the response, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the connection-token close.
>
> An HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but would decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server contains a Connection header with the connection-token close. In case the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than that request, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the connection-token close.

b. What encryption services are provided by HTTP?

> HTTP does not provide any encryption services.

c. Can a client open three or more simultaneous connections with a given  server? 



d. Either a server or a client may close a transport connection between them  if either one detects the connection has been idle for some time. Is it  possible that one side starts closing a connection while the other side is  transmitting data via this connection? Explain
