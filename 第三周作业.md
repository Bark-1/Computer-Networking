P6. Obtain the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616). Answer the following  questions:

a. Explain the mechanism used for signaling between the client and server to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed. Can the client, the server, or both signal the close of a connection

> From section 8.1.2 in RFC 2616, we can know that: 
>
> Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes place using the Connection header field. And either the client or the server can indicate to the other that it is going to close the persistent connection.
>
> An HTTP/1.1 server MAY assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including  the connection-token "close" was sent in the request. If the server  chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the response, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the connection-token close.
>
> An HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but would decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server contains a Connection header with the connection-token close. In case the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than that request, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the connection-token close.

b. What encryption services are provided by HTTP?

> HTTP does not provide any encryption services.

c. Can a client open three or more simultaneous connections with a given server? 

> From section 8.1.4 in RFC 2616, we can know that:
>
> Clients that use persistent connections SHOULD limit the number of simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy.

d. Either a server or a client may close a transport connection between them if either one detects the connection has been idle for some time. Is it possible that one side starts closing a connection while the other side is  transmitting data via this connection? Explain

> Yes. A client might have started to send a new request at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle" connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a request is in progress.



P12. Write a simple TCP program for a server that accepts lines of input from a client and prints the lines onto the server’s standard output. (You can do this by  modifying the TCPServer.py program in the text.) Compile and execute your  program. On any other machine that contains a Web browser, set the proxy  server in the browser to the host that is running your server program; also configure the port number appropriately. Your browser should now send its GET  request messages to your server, and your server should display the messages  on its standard output. Use this platform to determine whether your browser  generates conditional GET messages for objects that are locally cached.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
public class TCPServer {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("start");
    String message=null;//存放接受的字符串
    try{
        ServerSocket ss=new ServerSocket(5656); //port:5656
        do{
            Socket st=ss.accept();
        	BufferedReader input=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(st.getInputStream()));//创建一个从Socket中读文本行的流
            message=input.readLine();//读取客户机发送的一行文本
            System.out.println(message);//在屏幕中打印出来
            input.close();
        	st.close();
        }while(!message.equals("end"));//接收到“end”就结束通信
        ss.close();
    }catch(Exception e){
        System.out.println("It didn't work!"+e);
    }
}

}
```
