P5. Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.4. Assume a propagation speed  of 100 km/hour. 

a. Suppose the caravan travels 175 km, beginning in front of one tollbooth,  passing through a second tollbooth, and finishing just after a third toll-booth. What is the end-to-end delay? 

> The time taken by a car to travel 175 km = 175 km / (100 km/h) = 1.75 h
>
> The tollbooths service time = 12 * 10 * 3 sec = 6 min
>
> end-to-end time delay = 1.75 h + 6 min = 111 min

b. Repeat (a), now assuming that there are eight cars in the caravan instead  of ten

> The tollbooths service time = 12 * 8 * 3 sec =288 sec = 4.8 min
>
> end-to-end time delay = 1.75 h + 4.8 min = 109.8 min

P7. In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B  over a packet-switched network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a  digital 64 kbps bit stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte  packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its transmission rate is  10 Mbps and its propagation delay is 10 msec. As soon as Host A gathers a  packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it  converts the packet’s bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses from  the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A) until the  bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B)?

> The time for converting = 56 * 8 / (64 * 1000) = 7 ms
>
> Transmission time = 56 * 8 / (10 * 1000000) = 0.0448 ms
>
> Propagation delay = 10 ms
>
> total time = 7 + 0.0448 + 10 = 17.0448 ms

P25. Suppose two hosts, A and B, are separated by 20,000 kilometers and are connected by a direct link of R = 5 Mbps. Suppose the propagation speed over  the link is 2.5 * 10^8 meters/sec. 

a. Calculate the bandwidth-delay product, R * dprop. 

> dprop = 20000 * 1000 / (2.5 * 10^8) = 0.08 s
>
> R * dprop = 5 * 1000 * 1000 * 0.08 = 400000 bits

b. Consider sending a file of 800,000 bits from Host A to Host B. Suppose  the file is sent continuously as one large message. What is the maximum  number of bits that will be in the link at any given time? 

> The bandwidth‐delay product is the maximum number of bits that can be in the link
>
> 800000 bits > 400000 bits, so the maximum number of bits that will be in the link at any given time is 400000 bits

c. Provide an interpretation of the bandwidth-delay product. 

> The bandwidth‐delay product is the maximum number of bits that can be in the link 

d. What is the width (in meters) of a bit in the link? Is it longer than a  football field?

>  The width of a bit in the link = 20000 * 1000 / 400000 = 50 m
>
> A football field is 91.44 m
>
> So it is not longer than a football field

e. Derive a general expression for the width of a bit in terms of the  propagation speed s, the transmission rate R, and the length of the  link m

> The width of a bit = m / (R * dprop) = m / (R * m / s) = s / R
